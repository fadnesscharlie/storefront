# Store Front

In our application we want to create an application that can host items to display to users and be able to have those items filtered through categories such as "food" or "clothes" and display the correct items.

## Usage

Usage of our application includes being able to add multiple items from our store into a cart. You can see how many items are in your cart, as well as delete items from your cart.
